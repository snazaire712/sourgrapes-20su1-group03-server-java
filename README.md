Sour Grapes

By: Sharice Nazaire, Manvi Tandon, Anupama Kandasamy, Jialin Zhen 

1. State the problem you are trying to solve: 
Our project idea is aimed at optimizing users’ Netflix/film viewing experience during a time where social distancing is essential. More people are likely searching for entertainment options while quarantining, and watching shows is definitely one of them. It can be hard to find the perfect show to sink one’s teeth into, so our project aims to provide users with film reviews to help narrow down the options, and/or make their own reviews about films they have already seen. 
Netflix TV shows, movies, documentaries 
Rotten Tomatoes ratings and movie information
2. Include a description of at least two types of users that would use your Web application:
Professional Movie Reviewer/ Critic: -This user will add reviews of movies/TV shows they would like to rate
The professional critic gets to fill out a form that consists of their opinions/ratings (a more in depth review of the show/movie)
Review reader: This user will be able to read the reviews made by the movie reviewer and use them to help choose a movie/show to watch. 
Can also provide a quick rating based on 5 star system of overall experience  
3. For each of the types of users, provide two goals the user would like to achieve with your Web application:
Professional reviewers will be able to (1) login as an admin profile, (2) view a movie/show and (3) fill out a corresponding (general/consistent) form/checklist that will then be entered as data to the server as their review for others to see. This data will be portrayed to the audience so they can make a strategized selection.  
(1)The audience will also be able to give their feedback on a show or movie. As well as keep track of their personal data usage (what they like genre wise & the reviews they have given). (2)They will also be given a list of recommended videos tailored to the user’s previous searches.
4. State the overall strategy of how you intend to solve the problem:
Our overall strategy would first utilize the libraries in the netflix APIs to offer the user access to tv shows and movies provided by Netflix and also create a personalized recommended watch list for the user to watch based on their previous activity. Then using the Rotten Tomatoes API, we can also allow the user to see the reviews posted by critics and by other audience members in order to aid them in their decision. Overall, our web application will help users stay entertained with the best films/shows for them. Not only will they be able to use reviews to narrow down their options to shows of their liking, but will also have the opportunity to share their own opinions about shows they have already seen. This will help keep people busy and stay inside during these difficult times. 
Tracking activity and favorite genres over time
Personalized preference list
